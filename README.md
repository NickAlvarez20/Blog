## Project Name
BobTheBuilder's Blog
## About
This project is a personal blogging website created to document my coding journey, focusing on web development progress and experiments. Built using HTML and CSS, it showcases a static site with a clean, colorful design to track coding goals and learning milestones.
## Prerequisites
To view this project, you need a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) installed on your system.
No additional libraries are required, as it is a static website.
## Features
This Blog includes these features:

-Responsive navigation with a "Contents" menu linking to individual blog posts

-Styled blog posts with varied fonts, colors, and sizes for visual distinction

-Internal linking for easy navigation between sections and back to the contents

-Clean and colorful design using CSS for an engaging user experience

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/Blog.git`
## Usage
Open the index.html file in your web browser:

Simply double-click index.html or use open index.html in your terminal (on macOS) or start index.html (on Windows).

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Understand and apply HTML5 for structuring a static website with semantic elements

-Implement CSS styling, including custom fonts, colors, and sizes for visual hierarchy

-Differentiate between id and class selectors in CSS for targeted styling

-Practice internal linking to improve navigation and user experience
